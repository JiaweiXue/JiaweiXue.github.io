## Mobility History
* I visualize my mobility map as of June 2022. I enjoy visiting new places, which is modeled as a Bayesian procedure. I update my belief on a place based on real-time trip observations and historical prior envisions that come from books, news, videos, friends, papers, etc.  
* I define the optimal place to live from three perspectives:
  - infrastructure accessibility (e.g., not far from airports).
  - human community development (e.g., high life expectancy).
  - environment that inspires innovation (e.g., not too bustle, and not too loose).
* Then, I conclude three optimal places: 
  - Bonn, Germany.
  - Shaoxing, China.
  - Toledo, OH, U.S.
